# How to Graph Parabolas in Shifted Form
 
A parabola is a curve that has a shape of a U or an inverted U. The standard form of a parabola is *y = ax + bx + c*, where *a*, *b*, and *c* are constants. The shifted form of a parabola is *y = a(x - h) + k*, where *a*, *h*, and *k* are constants. The shifted form is useful for graphing parabolas because it shows the vertex (the highest or lowest point) of the parabola as (*h*, *k*). The sign of *a* determines whether the parabola opens up (*a > 0*) or down (*a < 0*). The value of *a* also affects the width of the parabola: the larger the absolute value of *a*, the narrower the parabola.
 
To graph a parabola in shifted form, follow these steps:

1. Identify the vertex (*h*, *k*) from the equation and plot it on the coordinate plane.
2. Determine whether the parabola opens up or down by looking at the sign of *a*.
3. Find the axis of symmetry, which is a vertical line that passes through the vertex. The equation of the axis of symmetry is *x = h*.
4. Choose two points on either side of the axis of symmetry and plug their x-coordinates into the equation to find their y-coordinates. Plot these points on the graph.
5. Draw a smooth curve that passes through the vertex and the other points.

Here is an example of graphing a parabola in shifted form:
 
**Example:** Graph *y = -2(x + 3) + 4*.
 
**Solution:**

- The vertex is (-3, 4), so we plot this point on the graph.
- The coefficient of *x* is -2, which means the parabola opens down.
- The axis of symmetry is *x = -3*, so we draw a dashed line at this value.
- We choose two points on either side of the axis of symmetry, such as (-4, 0) and (-2, 0). We plug these x-values into the equation to find their y-values:

y = -2(-1) + 4
y = -2(1) + 4
y = -2 + 4
y = 2</td></tr><tr><td>-2</td><td>y = -2(-2 + 3) + 4
y = -2(1) + 4
y = -2(1) + 4
y = -2 + 4
y = 2</td></tr></table></center>
We plot these points on the graph.
- We draw a smooth curve that passes through the vertex and the other points.
- The graph looks like this:

One of the applications of the shifted form of a parabola is to model real-world phenomena that have a maximum or minimum value, such as projectile motion, profit, height, etc. For example, if we want to find the maximum height of a ball thrown upward with an initial velocity of 20 m/s from a height of 1.5 m, we can use the equation *y = -4.9(x - 2.04) + 21.6*, where *y* is the height in meters and *x* is the time in seconds. The vertex of this parabola is (2.04, 21.6), which means that the ball reaches its maximum height of 21.6 m after 2.04 seconds.
  
You can also use the shifted form of a parabola to graph quadratic functions more easily by identifying the vertex and the axis of symmetry. For example, to graph *y = 3(x + 1) - 5*, you can plot the vertex (-1, -5) and draw the axis of symmetry *x = -1*. Then you can choose two points on either side of the axis of symmetry and plug their x-coordinates into the equation to find their y-coordinates. For example, if you choose x = -2 and x = 0, you get y = -2 and y = -2 respectively. Plot these points on the graph and draw a smooth curve that passes through them.
  
The shifted form of a parabola is also useful for finding the roots or zeros of a quadratic function, which are the x-values that make y equal to zero. To find the roots of *y = a(x - h) + k*, you can set y equal to zero and solve for x using the square root method. For example, to find the roots of *y = -2(x + 3) + 4*, you can do the following steps:

1. Set y equal to zero: *-2(x + 3) + 4 = 0*
2. Subtract 4 from both sides: *-2(x + 3) = -4*
3. Divide both sides by -2: *(x + 3) = 2*
4. Take the square root of both sides: *x + 3 = Â±â2*
5. Subtract 3 from both sides: *x = -3 Â±â2*
6. The roots are *x = -3 +â2* and *x = -3 -â2*

The shifted form of a parabola is a convenient way to write and graph quadratic functions that have been translated horizontally or vertically. It also helps us find important features of a parabola such as the vertex, the axis of symmetry, and the roots.
