If you want to learn new words and phrases in English, one of the best ways is to use a vocabulary book with a CD-ROM. A CD-ROM is a disc that you can insert into your computer and access interactive exercises, audio recordings, tests and more. Here are some of the benefits of using a CD-ROM with your vocabulary book:
 
- You can practice your pronunciation by listening to native speakers and repeating after them.
- You can check your understanding by doing quizzes and games that match words with definitions, pictures or contexts.
- You can review and revise your vocabulary by creating your own word lists and tests.
- You can learn more about the culture and usage of English by reading texts and listening to dialogues on various topics.

One of the most popular series of vocabulary books with CD-ROMs is *English Vocabulary in Use* by Cambridge University Press. This series covers four levels: Elementary, Pre-intermediate and Intermediate, Upper-intermediate and Advanced. Each book contains 100 units of vocabulary reference and practice, with clear explanations and examples on the left-hand pages and engaging activities on the right-hand pages. The CD-ROMs provide hundreds of additional exercises, as well as wordlists, dictionary support and audio recordings.

Now that you know some of the advantages of using a CD-ROM with your vocabulary book, you might be wondering how to use it effectively. Here are some tips to help you get the most out of your CD-ROM:

1. Install the CD-ROM on your computer by following the instructions on the disc or on the book[^1^]. You might need to use a program like Daemon Tools to mount the image files[^4^].
2. Explore the features of the CD-ROM and familiarize yourself with the interface. You can access different types of exercises, such as matching, gap-filling, multiple choice, crossword and word search. You can also listen to audio recordings of words and sentences, and record your own voice to compare your pronunciation.
3. Select a unit that matches your level and interest. You can follow the order of the book or choose any unit you like. You can also use the built-in dictionary to look up words and phrases that you don't know or want to review.
4. Do the exercises on the CD-ROM after you have studied the unit in the book. This will help you consolidate what you have learned and check your progress. You can also do the exercises before you study the unit in the book, as a way of testing yourself and finding out what you need to learn.
5. Review your results and feedback. The CD-ROM will give you scores and corrections for each exercise, as well as explanations and examples for some of the answers. You can also create your own tests and word lists to review your vocabulary at any time.

Using a CD-ROM with your vocabulary book is a fun and effective way to improve your English vocabulary. You can practice at your own pace, in your own time, and in your own way. You can also enjoy learning new words and phrases that will help you communicate better in English.
